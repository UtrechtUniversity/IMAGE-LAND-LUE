# Outputs

The outputs of IMAGE-LAND-LUE depend on the options selected in parameters.py. In general, outputs are saved in two formats: <a href='https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html'>npy</a> and tiff formats.

## Location
All outputs are stored in a directory named outputs, in imagelcm, the directory in which the model is stored.

## Viewing
Tiffs can be viewed using most GIS software, including the free <a href='https://qgis.org/en/site/'>QGIS</a>. Npy outputs can be visualised using the functions in `plotting.py` - see the relevant page <a href='../plotting.html'>here</a>.
