# Grass

As noted in <a href='IMAGE-LAND Allocation and Formulae.html'>IMAGE-LAND Allocation and Formulae</a>, fractions of each cell are allocated to grass such that grass demand is fulfilled and (in addition) any remaining fractions after other crops have been dealt with are given to grass.

Grass production is to an extent dependent on the grazing intensity of the two different grazing systems, intensive and extensive grazing. In practice, however, the management factor corresponding to grass in each region is a stand-in for the mean grazing intensity. Hence, it is the management factor for grass, not any grazing intensity data, that is used to compute grass production in IMAGE-LAND-LUE.
