# Key Differences

This page gives an overview of the key differences between the PBL's version of IMAGE-LAND, parts of which are discussed in <a href='Original IMAGE-LAND.html'>original IMAGE-LAND</a>, and the IMAGE-LAND-LUE implementation.

The various divergences are divided between differences in modern design which may be expected to stay, and differences due to the work-in-progress nature of IMAGE-LAND-LUE.
