# Biofuel Crops

IMAGE-LAND contains 5 biofuel crop types. In the 0-indexed list of IMAGE-LAND crop types, they span crop types 17-21, inclusive:
1. Grains (biofuel)
2. Oil crops (biofuel)
3. Sugar cane (biofuel)
4. Woody biofuel
5. Non-woody biofuel

Currently, biofuel allocation is not implemented in IMAGE-LAND-LUE. However, this would not require any major restructuring of the code, as the allocation rules for food and biofuel crops follow the same equations, detailed in <a href='IMAGE-LAND Allocation and Formulae.html'>IMAGE-LAND Allocation and Formulae</a>.
