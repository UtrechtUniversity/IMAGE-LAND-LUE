Welcome to ImageLCM's documentation!
====================================

.. raw:: html

   <p>IMAGE-LAND, also referred to as IMAGE-LCM (short for Land Cover Model), is the land-use change component of the IMAGE integrated assessment model (IAM). It is a global land-use change model, comprising 20 different <a href='md_files/Land Cover Types.html'>Land Cover Types</a>, with 16 <a href='md_files/Food Crops.html'>Food Crops</a> and 5 bioenergy crops.</p>


IMAGE-LAND, alongside the rest of the IMAGE IAM, was initially developed in the 1990s in FORTRAN by the `PBL <https://www.pbl.nl/en>`_. The most recent version of IMAGE developed by the PBL is IMAGE 3.2, detailed in the IMAGE `wiki <https://models.pbl.nl/image/index.php/Welcome_to_IMAGE_3.2_Documentation>`_; the IMAGE 3.0 `book <https://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/integrated-assessment-of-global-environmental-change-with-IMAGE-3.0>`_ discusses a version of the model released in 2014 in more depth.

Why this documentation?
#######################

You are now reading the documentation for a novel, open-source package which implements IMAGE-LAND using the `LUE framework <https://lue.computationalgeography.org/>`_ (`GitHub <https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue>`_). This package is the result of a collaboration between PBL and the `Faculty of Geosciences <https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-geosciences>`_ of Utrecht University.
