Welcome to ImageLCM's documentation!
====================================

IMAGE-LAND, also referred to as IMAGE-LCM (short for Land Cover Model), is the land-use change component of the IMAGE integrated assessment model (IAM). It is a global land-use change model, comprising 20 different [[Land Cover Types]], with 16 [[Food Crops]] and 5 bioenergy crops.

IMAGE-LAND, alongside the rest of the IMAGE IAM, was initially developed in the 1990s in FORTRAN by the [PBL](https://www.pbl.nl/en). The most recent version of IMAGE developed by the PBL is IMAGE 3.2, detailed in the IMAGE [wiki](https://models.pbl.nl/image/index.php/Welcome_to_IMAGE_3.2_Documentation); the IMAGE 3.0 [book](https://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/integrated-assessment-of-global-environmental-change-with-IMAGE-3.0) discusses a version of the model released in 2014 in more depth.
## Why this documentation?

You are now reading the documentation for a novel, open-source package which implements IMAGE-LAND using the [LUE framework](https://lue.computationalgeography.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue)). This package is the result of a collaboration between PBL and the [Faculty of Geosciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-geosciences) of Utrecht University.
